### Why Do I Like The Raft Problem?

I really like playing around with Raft implementations because:

* It actually addresses a real-world problem in an elegant way
* Like genetic algorithms, I find it really satisfying/interesting when adding randomness or noise makes a problem _easier_ to solve
* My software engineering experience has taken me through all manner of languages and software approaches, and I'm personally sold on the efficacy of **f**unctional **p**rogramming \(see [Li Hayoi's excellent tiramasu recipe](https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/WhatsFunctionalProgrammingAllAbout.html) for a great explanation for why\) - and applying randomness to FP concepts is satisfying
* It's not _quite_ as easy as it looks. You can verify a particular request produces a particular end state/response, but how about a suite of requests/responses? Do they all work in concert together as expected?
