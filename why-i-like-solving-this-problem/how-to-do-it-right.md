# How To Do It Right

Admittedly that is a click-bait title, but it doesn't mean it's wrong.

### What This Project is Trying to Show

A common health metric for software projects is to check how much a team trusts their tests. 

How confident is a team releasing a green build to production? Or a red build, for that matter? Do green/red tests accurately correlate with working/correct software, or how much manual intervention/oversight is required?

An initial reaction might be "I've used TDD" or "I always write extensive tests" so my project is ok.

If that's your answer, then great - but what do those tests look like? If you performed a non-trivial refactor, what tests would break, and of those broken tests, which are providing value pointing to a regression, and which are just tedious "Gah! Now I have to fix all these tests!!"?
