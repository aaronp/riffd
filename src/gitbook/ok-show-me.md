# OK - Show Me!

Ok - enough talk. I've taken the javascript output of this project and dumped it here, allowing you to run the server code on your computer, in your browser, right now.

Remember, this isn't client code, calling a server. Each new browser tab is the same as starting a new machine and adding it to the Raft cluster.

I think that's just so nifty \(and useful\). Making starting/pausing a new machine as easy as opening or closing a tab is just the bees knees.
