# Riff Raft

I hate writing tests. And I hate TDD. 

Don't get me wrong, I've been doing consulting/contracting work for over a decade, so I value and respect the way my clients and coworkers prefer to work, and will work with them to deliver software using TDD. And unless it turns out I've just been doing it wrong all this time \(and in which case I'll appreciate the opportunity to for my new Client X to show me the light\), I won't like it.

The reason I won't like it is because it doesn't come for free. It's a trade-off, and in my opinion doesn't bring a lot of value.
