# Riff Raft

This is a project I've been meaning to write for a long time.

It's the culmination of several lines of thought: primarily, 

[my views on testing](i-hate-tdd.md)

desire for immediate feedback

interest in applying functional programming to real-world problems

interest in distributing computing/consensus algorithms
